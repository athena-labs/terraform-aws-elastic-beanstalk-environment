Terraform module to provision AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment

## Searching for Maintainer!

The Cloud Posse team no longer utilizes Beanstalk all that much, but this module is still fairly popular. In an effort to give it the attention it deserves, we're searching for a volunteer maintainer to manage this specific repository's issues and pull requests (of which a number are already stacked up). This is a great opportunity for anyone who is looking to solidify and strengthen their Terraform skillset while also giving back to the SweetOps open source community!

[You can learn more about being a SweetOps contributor on our docs site here](https://docs.cloudposse.com/community/contributors/).

If you're interested, reach out to us via the `#terraform` channel in [the SweetOps Slack](https://slack.sweetops.com/) or directly [via email @ hello@cloudposse.com](mailto:hello@cloudposse.com)


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
